url: '' # the base hostname & protocol for your site

# the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
# All links will be namespaced by BASE_PATH if defined.
# Links in your website should always be prefixed with {{BASE_PATH}}
# however this value will be dynamically changed depending on your deployment situation.
#
# CNAME (http://yourcustomdomain.com)
#   DO NOT SET BASE_PATH
#   (urls will be prefixed with "/" and work relatively)

# GitHub Project Pages (http://username.github.io/project-name)

#   A GitHub Project site exists in the `gh-pages` branch of one of your repositories.
#  REQUIRED! Set BASE_PATH to: http://username.github.io/project-name
#
# CAUTION:
#   - When in Localhost, your site will run from root "/" regardless of BASE_PATH
#   - Only the following values are falsy: ["", null, false]
#   - When setting BASE_PATH it must be a valid url.
#     This means always setting the protocol (http|https) or prefixing with "/"
