I like walking. Walking for me meditates my mind. I have these little talks with myself. Recently I have been going through with my emotions. And I realize that instead of dwelling on things that hurts, lets focus on things that makes us happy. Easy to say but hard to do. I know "Life ain't easy", if it was, there won't be meaning in it right?

I do believe we are all a work in progress. My favorite book (and I would recommend it for a read)[UnLearn 101][unlearn] by Humble, says "Everything is temporary, there's really no need to hold on". What hits home is that our lives also are temporary so what's the use of spending most of our time to things that already happen (my brain says 'stop holding on', my heart says the opposite) or worry about things where we don't have control.

I'm in this situation that is not productive for my growth. I'm trying to learn to let go for me. There are things that's just wasn't mean to be. With that walk, I decided then to be happy (before its too late) and realize there are things or people in your life that you just need to let go. I'm sad since I usually hold on to the end, but I am very much thankful that it happened and would treasure those moments always. As my favorite poets would have said it in [When Loves Arrives][kay-kaye] "Thank you for stopping by".
