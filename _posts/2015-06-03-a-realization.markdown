Today, I didn't realize it but something is slowly changing within me. I think writing on this blog is the starting point of the realization of what happiness is for me. Maybe I'm getting old that it just didn't matter as much as yesterday. The want to fit in with the crowd to know/ feel where you belong.

I got tired of feeling sorry for myself 'coz I know deep inside I'm that good. Sounds not very humble of me, right? But hey I can say the same thing of you :) You are good. You are meant to do great things so get up and stop worrying about what others think (they are also worried what others think, its like thinkception ). Honestly I still have those feelings, but its much easier now since I don't get suck in to that hole. I don't know where I'm going but I'm enjoying this journey of mine. I am amaze of the happiness I felt when I started writing. (Thank you for reading btw.) 

I think its the freedom that made me happy, the courage to take the first step (in my case , my first article). For all those years my mind keep putting it off. ARgh! mind your holding me back. But thank you mind for opening up things I thought not possible in the past. 

When you think about it, you and me are not that different. We have similar journeys and fears to conquer the difference is in the actual battle. Lets be great together! Lets be happy :)
