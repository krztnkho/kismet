So I finally got to watch Pitch Perfect 2 after a week of listening to the soundtrack! All I can say is I absolutely love it :) I got captured by the camping scenes and the Bella's performance for the world championship. It's those moments of the heart that gets to me. Those little conversation with the people close to you comes back. For the longest time that I can remember I have been searching for "that" something to happen. Being so busy with looking that I did not know that it already found me. 

Songs in the soundtrack I love: (Just a note I love all the music in the soundtrack, but these few are my favorites) 

1. Kennedy Center Performance (we got the world)
2. Back to Basics 
3. Cups
4. Flashlight

I love the songs 'coz it hits something inside me. 

For #1, we are all freaks when we are having fun, especially when your accompanied by your 'crazy' friend :) (you know those moments)The moments that you don't care about whats going on but that moment shared with the person beside you.

For #2 I got to say this, I'm getting old, but I love songs that reminds me of my past. It brings those precious memories back to life, and you just can't help but smile.

For #3 Hey, I loved this in Pitch Perfect when Becca used this for her audition, how can I not loved this in Pitch Perfect 2! especially when they use it when they're about to leave Barden. It just comes into full circle for me.

For #4 Now this song, I did not expect to like. But the lyrics felt very powerful for me. I just realize 'the you' in the song in my life. With all the stuffs going on in our lives, we forget that if we stop and look, the people who we're looking for are already there in our lives. And every time I hear this song , I just have had the urge to tell all those people how much they mean to me and I appreciate them for being there. you won't believe it but when I told them they just stare back at me and say 'are you okay?' hahaha I'm the cheezy one and I know I mean a lot to them too :) Love you guys, you know who you are. 

So this here ends my article, thank you for taking your time to read. This is me saying 'tin out'.
