I always wanted to improve myself, be better in what i do, be rich and all those good things. Who doesn't? I used to think that maybe this is where I should be (It's nice here its comfortable. y'know). All those articles in the internet about from rags to riches stories, pursuing their passion and coming out of it better. It keeps bugging me , as who doesn't want to be successful in life. So just one day i got tired of all my excuses about being busy and just started to read a book. Honestly there was no goal I just want to do something. And as the quote goes "Finishing last will always be better than not finishing which is way better than not starting at all".
