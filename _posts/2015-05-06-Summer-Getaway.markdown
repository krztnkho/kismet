We were supposed to go to another island, but sadly all resort in Camotes was fully booked. A lesson: should booked earlier around a month would be good. Honestly I just wanted a break from the hurly-burly day at the office, but was surprised that I had a lot of fun than was expected. 

So our itinerary was:
Day 1: Arrive at resort
Day 2: Kawasan
Day 3: Go Home

The resort at Badian : [Terra Manna][terra-manna], was amazing. Although the beach was not all that (a bit disappointed because I was excited to swim),but we get to kayak (banca cruise) all we want.  I'd bet its a great place for snorkeling and diving as there are a lot of corals and sea urchins underwater (haven't tried though). For me , I'm good with kayaking :) During day 1, tried the beach but it was not as fun as on day 3 coz we went a lot farther with the kayak and arrive at Lambug beach resort, Badian's public beach. They have the perfect beach over there, white sands and beautiful skies. It did not matter if I get sunburns, still have them now, but swimming there was worth the rowing of the kayak and the heat of the sun. It was one of the highlights of the weekend aside from [the falls][kawasan]. The kawasan was another story, my first time to swim in a waterfall. It was sooo cold, and I usually get cramps with that kind of temperature. But as the word goes `YOLO`. You only live once so I endured the cold till it got comfortable and once you get to swimming around the falls you forget the cold. It was a wonderful experience , we went behind the waterfall which was so splashy (if there's such a word) and the water gets in our eyes. All worth it! :) Some people jump at the top of the falls and swing in the trees to dive in the water. Didn't try that , it's easy to jump but the climb is harder maybe when I get to slim down. ;)
